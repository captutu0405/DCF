# DCF
DCF is an approach to detect underlying relationships between genes and diseases by seamlessly combining the deep architecture, SDAE model for auxiliary side information and the collaborative filter for the gene-disease association matrix.

DCF operates on large collections of heterogeneous data sets, such as gene expression, gene-gene interactions, gene orthology, OMIM pages and disease similarity networks. 

This repository contains supplementary material for Deep collaborative filtering for prediction of disease genes.
